		"event": "\nComet C/2022 (E3) ZTF, which was recorded around magnitude 5 a week ago, is now skimming away from the North Celestial Pole and passing close to Mars. After dark, look for the Red Planet, glowing at magnitude 0 in the southeastern sky. \n \nSwing binoculars or a small scope up to Mars’ location about an hour and a half after sunset, then look 1.7° northeast. You should land right on ZTF, glowing softly green as dicarbon in its atmosphere fluoresces. It’s a stunning sight, and wide-field scopes should be able to capture both in the same field of view. Additioanlly, the open cluster NGC 1746 lies about 4° to ZTF’s southeast, or nearly 5° east-southeast of Mars. \n \nAny camera capable of taking long-exposure shots should capture the scene beautifully in the sky above the landscape of your choosing, accompanied by the Pleiades to the right (west) and Orion to the lower left (southeast). \n \nNote that the comet is still moving quickly, covering nearly 3° per night, though it is slowing down. By the same time tomorrow night, ZTF will have slid due south and will appear 1.8° southeast of Mars. \n \n"
